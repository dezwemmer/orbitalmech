This file repository is a collection of works on orbital mechanics
and dynamics designed to broaden my knowledge and expertise as well
as strengthen existing experience both in programming and in orbital
mechanics and dynamics.

The structure is fluid, but in general, there are folders containing
exercise work, as well as algorithms to serve specific functions.
Future work will center on a contained software structure that makes
use of these algorithms in a more collective software package.
